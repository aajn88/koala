*This product was inspired by Facebook/Meta's bunnylol search engine but faster/easier to setup and no need of external servers*

## Configure Chrome (and still keep Google!) üåê

We all love Google. Don't worry. **If Koala doesn't recognize the command then it'll just Google it by default**. However, to use Koala and keep Google suggestions, follow these steps:

1. Setup Koala as your default engine (don't worry, you'll keep Google! Any non-existent command will be Googled).
  1. Add any name and shortcut you want but make sure the URL is `https://us-central1-koala-search.cloudfunctions.net/koalapp?q=%s` (or `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s` if you're using your own server).
  1. Make Koala the default search engine.
1. Change Google to have shortcut as `g`.
1. Voil√°. You can now search with Koala, if you need google suggestions, just type `g` followed by a space.
